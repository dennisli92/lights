This is a toy app that uses the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) to try and visualize sound as a single color.

It attempts to achieve this by characterizing sound as a combination of pitch, loudness (not to be confused with intensity), and timbre. These values are then mapped into color space.
